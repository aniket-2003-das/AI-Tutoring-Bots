added_text = """In the last chapter we developed the concepts of position,
    displacement, velocity and acceleration that are needed to
    describe the motion of an object along a straight line. We
    found that the directional aspect of these quantities can be
    taken care of by + and â€“ signs, as in one dimension only two
    directions are possible. But in order to describe motion of an
    object  in  two  dimensions  (a  plane)  or  three  dimensions
    (space),  we  need  to  use  vectors  to  describe  the  above-
    mentioned physical quantities.  Therefore, it is first necessary
    to learn the language of vectors. What is a vector? How to
    add, subtract and multiply vectors ? What is the result of
    multiplying a vector by a real number ? We shall learn this
    to  enable  us  to  use  vectors  for  defining  velocity  and
    acceleration in a plane. We then discuss motion of an object
    in a plane.  As a simple case of motion in a plane, we shall
    discuss motion with constant acceleration and treat in detail
    the projectile motion. Circular motion is a familiar class of
    motion that has a special significance in daily-life situations.
    We shall discuss uniform circular motion in some detail.
    The equations developed in this chapter for motion in a
    plane can be easily extended to the case of three dimensions."""
