The provided content is from a physics textbook and it discusses the concept of units and measurement. 
It explains that physics is a quantitative science based on the measurement of physical quantities. 
The fundamental or base quantities in physics are length, mass, time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, 
and luminous intensity. Each base quantity is defined in terms of a reference standard called a unit. 
The units for the base quantities are called fundamental or base units. 
Other physical quantities, derived from the base quantities, can be expressed as a combination of the base units and are called derived units. 
The International System of Units (SI) is the internationally accepted unit system and is widely used throughout the world. 
The content also includes examples of calculations involving units and significant figures.
